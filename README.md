# Microsoft-365-Administration

This portfolio documents hands-on practice with core Microsoft 365 administration tasks using an administrative account in a non-production environment. The focus of this lab was to gain practical exposure to common Tier 1 / Tier 2 support activities, including user management, license assignment, MFA configuration, shared mailbox access, and sign-in log review.

All tasks were performed to mirror real-world support scenarios commonly encountered in enterprise and educational IT environments and are documented here for learning and demonstration purposes.


## Lab Objectives

- Practice real-world Microsoft 365 user administration
- Perform common Tier 1 / Tier 2 support tasks
- Gain familiarity with identity, licensing, security, and auditing features
- Document work in a clear, professional format suitable for a portfolio
